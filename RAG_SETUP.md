# AI-Powered Suggested Replies (RAG) Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up and use the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) feature for AI-powered email reply suggestions.

## Overview

The RAG feature uses a Vector Database (Qdrant) combined with Google's Gemini AI to generate intelligent, context-aware email reply suggestions based on your product knowledge and outreach agenda.

## Architecture

The RAG pipeline works in the following steps:

1. **Product Data Storage**: Your product information, meeting links, pricing, and FAQs are stored as text chunks in Qdrant vector database
2. **Embedding Generation**: When a user requests a reply suggestion, the email content is converted to embeddings using Gemini API
3. **Vector Search**: The system searches for the most relevant product data based on the email content
4. **Reply Generation**: Gemini AI generates a professional reply using both the email context and retrieved product information

## Prerequisites

1. **Gemini API Key**: Already configured in your environment
2. **Qdrant Cloud Account**: Free tier available at https://cloud.qdrant.io

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create a Qdrant Cloud Account

1. Visit https://cloud.qdrant.io
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Create a new cluster (free tier: 1GB storage)
4. Note your cluster URL (e.g., `https://your-cluster.qdrant.cloud`)
5. Create an API key from the cluster settings

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

Add the following to your `.env` file in the `backend` directory:

```bash
# Qdrant Configuration
QDRANT_URL=https://your-cluster.qdrant.cloud
QDRANT_API_KEY=your_qdrant_api_key_here

# Seed default product data on startup (optional)
SEED_PRODUCT_DATA=true
```

The `GEMINI_API_KEY` should already be configured from the previous setup.

### Step 3: Restart the Backend

The backend will automatically:
- Connect to Qdrant
- Create the `product_knowledge` collection
- Seed default product data (if `SEED_PRODUCT_DATA=true`)

Check the backend logs for confirmation:
```
Initializing Qdrant vector database...
Qdrant collection created: product_knowledge
Seeding default product data...
Successfully seeded default product data
Qdrant vector database ready
```

### Step 4: Customize Product Data (Optional)

The system comes with default product data including:
- Meeting scheduling links
- Product features overview
- Pricing information
- Integration details
- Security & compliance info
- Support channels
- Case studies

To customize this data:

1. Edit `backend/src/utils/seedProductData.ts`
2. Update the `defaultProductData` array with your actual product information
3. Restart the backend with `SEED_PRODUCT_DATA=true`

### Step 5: Add Product Data via API (Optional)

You can also add product data programmatically:

**Add a single item:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/product-data \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "text": "Our product pricing starts at $29/month...",
    "category": "pricing",
    "metadata": {
      "type": "pricing_info",
      "priority": "high"
    }
  }'
```

**Add multiple items:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/product-data/batch \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "items": [
      {
        "text": "We offer 24/7 support...",
        "category": "support"
      },
      {
        "text": "Book a demo at calendly.com/your-link",
        "category": "meeting_scheduling"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

**View all product data:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/product-data
```

## Using the Feature

### Frontend UI

1. Open an email in the application
2. Click the **"âœ¨ Suggest Reply"** button
3. Wait for the AI to generate a suggested reply (usually 2-5 seconds)
4. Review the suggested reply and the context used
5. Click **"ðŸ“‹ Copy Reply"** to copy to clipboard
6. Paste and customize as needed in your email client

### API Usage

**Generate a suggested reply:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/emails/{email_id}/suggest-reply
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "reply": "Thank you for your interest in our product...",
  "context": [
    {
      "text": "Our product features include...",
      "category": "product_features",
      "relevance": "89.5%"
    }
  ],
  "confidence": "85.3%"
}
```

## How It Works

### RAG Pipeline Flow

1. **User clicks "Suggest Reply"** on an email
2. **Email content is embedded** using Gemini's `text-embedding-004` model
3. **Vector search retrieves** the top 3 most relevant product data chunks from Qdrant
4. **Prompt is assembled** with:
   - System instruction (be professional, concise, helpful)
   - Retrieved context from vector DB
   - Original email content
5. **Gemini generates** a reply using `gemini-2.0-flash-exp` model
6. **Reply is returned** with confidence score and context used

### Customization Options

#### Adjust Context Retrieval

In `backend/src/routes/ragRoutes.ts`, you can adjust the `topK` parameter:

```typescript
const suggestion = await suggestReply({
  subject: email.subject,
  body: email.body,
  from: email.from,
  date: email.date,
}, 5); // Retrieve top 5 most relevant contexts instead of 3
```

#### Modify System Instructions

Edit the system instruction in `backend/src/ai/ragService.ts` to change the tone or style of generated replies.

## Troubleshooting

### "RAG features will be unavailable"

**Cause**: Missing `QDRANT_URL` or `GEMINI_API_KEY`
**Solution**: Ensure both environment variables are set in `.env`

### "Failed to generate suggested reply"

**Possible causes:**
1. Qdrant cluster is down or unreachable
2. Gemini API rate limit exceeded
3. No product data in vector database

**Solutions:**
- Check Qdrant cluster status in cloud console
- Verify API keys are correct
- Seed product data using `SEED_PRODUCT_DATA=true`

### Low Confidence Scores

**Cause**: No relevant product data for the email topic
**Solution**: Add more specific product information covering common customer questions and topics

## Performance Considerations

- **Embedding generation**: ~200-500ms per request
- **Vector search**: ~50-100ms
- **Reply generation**: ~1-3 seconds
- **Total**: ~2-5 seconds per suggestion

For high-volume usage, consider:
- Caching embeddings for frequently asked questions
- Using batch processing for multiple emails
- Implementing rate limiting on the frontend

## Best Practices

1. **Keep product data updated**: Regularly review and update your product information in the vector DB
2. **Organize by category**: Use meaningful categories (pricing, features, support, etc.) to track what context is being used
3. **Monitor confidence scores**: Low confidence suggests missing or irrelevant product data
4. **Review context used**: Check which product data chunks are being retrieved to improve relevance
5. **Customize replies**: Use AI suggestions as a starting point, then personalize for each recipient

## Security & Privacy

- Email data is only sent to Gemini API for reply generation (never stored by Google)
- Product data is stored in your Qdrant cluster
- API keys should be kept secure and never committed to version control
- All communication uses HTTPS/TLS encryption

## Cost Estimation

### Qdrant Cloud (Free Tier)
- 1GB storage: **Free**
- ~10,000-50,000 vectors depending on text length

### Gemini API
- Embeddings: $0.00001 per 1K characters (~$0.01 per 1,000 emails)
- Reply generation: $0.00015 per 1K characters (~$0.15 per 1,000 replies)

**Estimated cost for 1,000 suggestions**: ~$0.16

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Set up Qdrant Cloud account and configure environment variables
2. âœ… Verify backend starts successfully with Qdrant connection
3. âœ… Review and customize default product data
4. âœ… Test reply suggestions on sample emails
5. âœ… Monitor context relevance and adjust product data as needed
6. âœ… Train your team on using the feature effectively

## Support

For issues or questions:
- Check backend logs for detailed error messages
- Verify all environment variables are set correctly
- Ensure Qdrant cluster is accessible
